# We are creating the Pythagforas Theorem calculator
# We are aksing the user to enter the value of a,b side
a = input("Enter the value of side(a): ")
b = input("Enter the value of side(b): ")
# Convert the string to int
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
# This is the formual of Pythagoras Theorem
sum = a**2+b**2
# At last we have to print the statement
print(f"The value of Pythagoras Theorem is: {sum}")

###OUTPUT###
# Enter the value of side(a): 2
# Enter the value of side(b): 3
# The value of Pythagoras Theorem is: 13
