# We are calculating the area of rectangle
#We are asking the user to give the values of width and height
w = input("Enter the value of Width(W): ")
l = input("Enter the value of Height(H): ")

#now we convert the number into the float
w = float(w)
l = float(l)

#this is the formula for area of rectangle
sum = w*l
#now we will print the statement
print(f"This is the value of area of rectangle: {sum} Cm")

#########OUTPUT##########
# Enter the value of Width(W): 5
# Enter the value of Height(H): 8
# This is the value of area of rectangle: 40.0 Cm
