# We are calculating the area of Square
#We are asking the user to give the value of side
a = input("Enter the value of Side(S): ")

#now we convert the number into the float
a = int(a)

#this is the formula for area of Square
sum = (a**2)
#now we will print the statement
print(f"This is the value of area of Square: {sum} Cm")


########OUTPUT########
# Enter the value of Side(S): 5
# This is the value of area of Square: 25 Cm
