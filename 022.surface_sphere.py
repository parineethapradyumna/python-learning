# We are creating the surface of a Sphere calculator
# Asking the user to enter the value of radius 
r = input("Enter the value of Radius(r): ")
#Convert the string to float
r = float(r)
# This is the formual of surface of a Sphere
sum = 4*3.14*r**2
# Print the output
print(f"The value of Surface of a Sphere is : {sum} Cm")

####OUTPUT####
# Enter the value of Radius(r): 7
# The value of Surface of a Sphere is : 615.44 Cm
